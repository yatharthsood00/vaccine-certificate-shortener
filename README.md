# Vaccine Certificate Shortener
## THIS IS NOT A CERTIFICATE GENERATOR, PLEASE USE IT RESPONSIBLY
(Under Development) A project to abridge your vaccine certificate to make it more mobile-friendly. Other formats may be added later as well. **CoWIN certificates only.**

This first design is intended to be used and previewed on the phone screen, with all essential information preserved in the conversion, including the verification QR code. A design mockup is in the repository:

Currently, all code is in a Jupyter Notebook while I figure out the best way to release the project using only Python (not a requirement, just something I am more comfortable with), while also not compromising anyone's data.
