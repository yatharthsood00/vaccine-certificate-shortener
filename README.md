# Vaccine Certificate Shortener
## THIS IS NOT A CERTIFICATE GENERATOR, PLEASE USE IT RESPONSIBLY
(Under Development) A project to abridge your vaccine certificate to make it more mobile-friendly. Other formats may be added later as well. **CoWIN certificates only.**

This first design is intended to be used and previewed on the phone screen, with all essential information preserved in the conversion, including the verification QR code. A design mockup is in the repository:

The code in the Jupyter Notebook will be no longer updated as I have moved it to a .py file. and now things are "normal", apart from there being a lack of a UI and a way to package the project. Although you can still run the project after modifying some code.
